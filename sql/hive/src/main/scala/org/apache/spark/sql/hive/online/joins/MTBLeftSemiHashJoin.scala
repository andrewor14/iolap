/**
 * Multi-time broadcast implementation of left semi hash join.
 * Remarks:
 *  1. Now we only handle the case with AlmostFixed build side.
 *    We assume "almost-fixed" means that the first iteration will see all the keys.
 *    Therefore, we have the following remarks.
 *  2. We keep track of all the keys all of whose flags are false from the build side,
 *    and throw exception if we see new keys out of this set in later iterations.
 *  3. We cache from the stream side the tuples with true flags
 *    but joined with at least one false-flagged build-side tuple.
 *    Stream-side cache is saved in state.
 *  4. Build-side cache is saved in broadcast.
 *  5. We refresh both build-side and stream-side caches.
